---

## Field Length Limits

| Field Type | Max Length | Example Fields |
|:-----------|:-----------|:---------------|
| Merchant ID | 32 | `merchant_id` |
| User ID | 64 | `user_id`, `merchant_user_id` |
| Agreement No | 64 | `agreement_no`, `external_agreement_no` |

---

## Idempotency

Idempotency is guaranteed through business unique indexes:

| Business Scenario | Idempotency Key | Unique Index |
|:------------------|:----------------|:-------------|
| Sign Request | external_agreement_no | (merchant_id, external_agreement_no) |
| Deduction Order | out_trade_no | (merchant_id, out_trade_no) |
| Refund Request | out_refund_no | (merchant_id, out_refund_no) |

**Notes:**
- `X-Request-Id` is used for request tracing and troubleshooting
- Format requirement: UUID v4, e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`
- Repeated requests with the same merchant order number return the result of the first request

---

## API Timeout Recommendations

| API | Recommended Timeout | Description |
|:----|:--------------------|:------------|
| Sign Request | 10 seconds | Sync return sign link |
| Sign Confirmation | 10 seconds | Sync return sign status |
| Unsign | 10 seconds | Sync return unsign result |
| Agreement Deduction | 30 seconds | May involve on-chain operations |
| Deduction Refund | 30 seconds | May involve on-chain operations |
| Query APIs | 10 seconds | Sync return query result |

**Timeout Handling:**
- After timeout, call query API to confirm actual status
- Deduction/refund timeout does not mean failure
- Confirm final status through query or async notification

---

## Concurrency Handling

### Same Agreement Concurrent Deductions

- Same agreement supports concurrent deduction requests
- Each deduction needs different `out_trade_no`
- Limit verification is real-time; concurrent requests may be rejected if exceeding quota

### Same Order Repeated Requests

- Requests with same `out_trade_no` are treated as the same transaction
- After first request succeeds, repeated requests return the first result (idempotent)
- After first request fails, use a new `out_trade_no` to retry

---

## Transaction Status Flow

### Deduction Status

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │  PROCESSING │
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │
           ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
           │               │               │
           ▼               ▼               ▼
    ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐
    │   SUCCESS   │ │   FAILED    │ │   TIMEOUT   │
    └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘
```

| Status | Description | Follow-up Actions |
|:-------|:------------|:------------------|
| PROCESSING | Deduction in progress | Wait for notification or query |
| SUCCESS | Deduction successful | Can initiate refund |
| FAILED | Deduction failed | Retry with new order number |
| TIMEOUT | Deduction timeout | Query to confirm, then decide |

### Refund Status

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │  PROCESSING │
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │
                ┌──────────┴──────────┐
                │                     │
                ▼                     ▼
         ┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐
         │   SUCCESS   │       │   FAILED    │
         └─────────────┘       └─────────────┘
```

| Status | Description | Follow-up Actions |
|:-------|:------------|:------------------|
| PROCESSING | Refund in progress | Wait for notification or query |
| SUCCESS | Refund successful | Funds returned to user |
| FAILED | Refund failed | Check reason, retry with new refund number |

**Refund Notes:**
- Refund amount cannot exceed refundable amount
- Same transaction supports multiple partial refunds
- Used quota is restored after successful refund

---

## Rate Limiting

### Rate Limit Strategy

| API Type | Dimension | Threshold | Description |
|:---------|:----------|:----------|:------------|
| Sign Request | Merchant + User | 10/minute | Same merchant for same user |
| Agreement Deduction | Merchant | 1000/second | Merchant-level QPS |
| Agreement Deduction | Agreement | 10/second | Single agreement frequency |
| Query APIs | Merchant | 5000/second | All query APIs shared |
| Refund API | Merchant | 500/second | Merchant-level refund rate |

### Rate Limit Response

HTTP status `429` with body:

```json
{
  "retCode": 42900,
  "retMsg": "Too many requests, please try again later",
  "result": {
    "retry_after": 1000
  }
}
```

### Handling Recommendations

1. **Exponential Backoff**: Retry with delays (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
2. **Request Merging**: Use list query API instead of multiple single queries
3. **Async Processing**: Use message queue for peak shaving in high concurrency
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor 429 response ratio, adjust strategy accordingly

## Agreement Type Description

Agreement type (`agreement_type`) defines the deduction mode of agreement payment, affecting deduction frequency, limit configuration, and agreement lifecycle.

### Agreement Type Comparison

| Type | Description | Applicable Scenarios | Deduction Frequency | Limit Configuration Support | Agreement Lifecycle |
|:-----|:------------|:--------------------|:-------------------|:---------------------------|:-------------------|
| **CYCLE** | Periodic deduction | Fixed periodic deduction for subscription scenarios | Periodic deduction (e.g., monthly) | Single limit + Period limits (DAY/WEEK/MONTH/YEAR) | Long-term validity, expires upon term end or cancellation |
| **NON_CYCLE** | Non-periodic deduction | Non-fixed deduction cycle, merchant can initiate anytime | Irregular deduction (triggered by actual consumption) | Single limit + Period limits (DAY/WEEK/MONTH/YEAR) | Long-term validity, expires upon term end or cancellation |
| **SINGLE** | Single authorization | One-time valid, agreement automatically expires after deduction | One-time deduction only | Single limit only | Short-term validity, automatically expires after successful deduction |

### Typical Scenario Examples

**CYCLE - Periodic Deduction**
- **Membership Subscription**: Video membership, music subscription, gym monthly card, cloud service annual fee
- **Bill Payment**: Monthly utility bills, property fees, monthly mobile plan fees
- **Characteristics**: Fixed deduction time, amounts may be same or different

**NON_CYCLE - Non-Periodic Deduction**
- **Transportation Services**: Ride-hailing, parking fees, ETC tolls, public transit
- **Food & Beverage**: Food delivery orders, restaurant membership deduction
- **Lifestyle Services**: Laundry, repair, car rental
- **Characteristics**: Triggered by actual consumption, irregular deduction frequency and amounts

**SINGLE - Single Authorization**
- **Pre-authorization Scenarios**: Hotel deposits, car rental deposits
- **One-time Deduction**: One-time authorized payment, temporary deduction
- **Characteristics**: Agreement automatically expires after deduction, no manual cancellation needed

### Limit Configuration Description

**CYCLE and NON_CYCLE Types**:
- Support **Single Limit** (`single_limit`): Maximum amount per deduction
- Support **Period Limits** (`period_limits`):
  - DAY: Daily accumulated deduction limit
  - WEEK: Weekly accumulated deduction limit
  - MONTH: Monthly accumulated deduction limit
  - YEAR: Yearly accumulated deduction limit
- Multiple period limits can be configured simultaneously, platform validates all limits

**SINGLE Type**:
- Only supports **Single Limit** (`single_limit`)
- Period limits not supported (as agreement expires after deduction)

### Agreement Lifecycle Comparison

| Operation | CYCLE | NON_CYCLE | SINGLE |
|:----------|:------|:----------|:-------|
| **After Sign** | SIGNED status, can deduct | SIGNED status, can deduct | SIGNED status, can deduct |
| **First Deduction** | Remains SIGNED | Remains SIGNED | Automatically becomes UNSIGNED (agreement expires) |
| **Multiple Deductions** | Supported | Supported | Not supported (expires after first deduction) |
| **User Cancellation** | Supported | Supported | Not applicable (auto-expires after deduction) |
| **Merchant Cancellation** | Supported | Supported | Not applicable (auto-expires after deduction) |
| **Agreement Expiration** | Becomes EXPIRED | Becomes EXPIRED | Not applicable (auto-expires after deduction) |

### Usage Recommendations

1. **Choose Appropriate Type**:
   - Subscription-based business: Choose **CYCLE**
   - On-demand consumption business: Choose **NON_CYCLE**
   - One-time authorization: Choose **SINGLE**

2. **Limit Configuration Principles**:
   - Single limit should cover most transaction scenarios
   - Period limits prevent excessive short-term deductions
   - CYCLE type recommended to configure monthly limit
   - NON_CYCLE type recommended to configure daily limit

3. **Agreement Management**:
   - CYCLE/NON_CYCLE agreements require active cancellation or await expiration
   - SINGLE agreements auto-expire after deduction, no management needed
   - Recommend setting reasonable validity period (`sign_valid_time`) for long-term agreements
